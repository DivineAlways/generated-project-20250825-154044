# Spicy AI Content Creator Course Website

This project contains all the necessary files for a simple, static website for a course on creating 'spicy' content using AI.

The project is organized into several key directories:

- **`index.html`**: The main project hub. This page provides navigation to all other parts of the project.
- **`/docs`**: Contains all project documentation in Markdown format, including the project overview, requirements, and user flows.
- **`/wireframes`**: Contains low-fidelity HTML wireframes that outline the structure and layout of the website pages.
- **`/prototype`**: A high-fidelity, interactive, and mobile-friendly prototype built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a clickable simulation of the final website.

## How to Use

1.  Start by opening the main `index.html` file in your browser.
2.  Use the navigation cards to explore the documentation, wireframes, and the interactive prototype.
